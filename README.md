=================

My Github-hosted portfolio site, which can be viewed live [here](http://www.echeung.me).

Development is done on the **draft** branch, and a [rake task](http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html) is used to deploy the fully generated site to the **master** branch, in order to make use of plugins while still using GitHub Pages.
